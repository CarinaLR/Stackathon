**#GET ME FIT!**

##A mobile app that provides a weekly meal plan to the user based on how much weight the user would like to lose.

##Built with **React-Native** which provides a better experience to the user.

##This is a project that I will continue working, implementing Node, Express, Sequelize, and Redux.

##The first attempt was built with Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS files.
